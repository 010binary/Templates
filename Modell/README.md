# Model project Readme

Welcome to Project 2! This project is a simple web page that features a modal. The modal is triggered by clicking a button, providing a clean and interactive user experience. The project consists of the following files and directories:

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- **logic.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic to control the modal's display.
- **style.scss**: The main SCSS file for styling the web page.
- **README.md**: The readme file you are currently reading.
- **style/**:
  - **style.css**: The compiled CSS file generated from the style.scss file.
  - **style.min.css**: A minified version of the compiled CSS.
- **img/**:
  - **picture.JPG**: An image used as the background for the web page.

## JavaScript (logic.js)

The `logic.js` file contains the JavaScript logic for the modal functionality. It declares variables for the open button, modal container, and close button. Event listeners are set up to handle opening and closing the modal when the corresponding buttons are clicked. Additionally, clicking outside the modal also closes it.

## HTML (index.html)

The `index.html` file defines the structure of the web page. It includes a button to trigger the modal and the modal container with its content. The necessary styles and JavaScript are linked to this file.

## SCSS (style.scss)

The `style.scss` file contains the styling for the web page. It includes styles for the body, open button, modal container, and modal itself. The styling is designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interface.

## CSS (style/style.css)

The `style.css` file is the compiled CSS generated from the `style.scss` file. It contains the styles used to visually enhance the HTML elements on the web page.

## Images (img/picture.JPG)

The `picture.JPG` file in the `img` directory is used as the background image for the web page. It adds a visually appealing backdrop to the content.

## Usage

To view the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Click the "Where's our modal?" button to trigger the modal and see the animation and styling in action.

Feel free to customize the content, styles, and functionality according to your needs. Enjoy exploring and building upon this simple modal project!
